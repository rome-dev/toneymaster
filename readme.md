# Welcome to the Tourney Master Gitlub repo

## AWS
The backend of our React app is AWS. AWS Cognito handles authentication, APIs are via appsynch/API gateway, and the database is on RDS. The database for Tourney Master is the ``events`` database.
1. Cognito user pool = tourneymaster
1. S3; static website hosting for the React code as well as client files

## Storybook
We are fans of the modularity of Storybook and would like to see as much of it incorporated as possible.
